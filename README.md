# AbyssWorks

This mod exists as a utility mod for the AbyssWorks modpack, which I'm developing separately.
Not putting the modpack on github with packwiz or anything because I quite simply can't be bothered.

## Current Features
- Throwing a Hex Gummy into Thought Slurry turns it into an Amethyst Seedling.
- Amethyst Seedlings can be planted on top of Sagely Ice while under Thought Slurry to slowly grow into Crystallized Media.

## TODO
- ~~Drop table for Crystallized Media.~~ Done!
- Plasmoidal Growbed to use as farmland for Crystallized Media.
- Essence system (Explanation is out of scope for this readme, will add one with the system)
- Research system for essence
- Screeching Minds and Media Rigs (again, can't be bothered to explain rn)
- Method to spawn mobs (possibly flaying Screeching Minds?)

## Implemented in pack via other methods
- Spawn player in modified noosphere (lacks structures)
- Change Thought Slurry to be transparent

## TODO in pack via other methods
- Quests
